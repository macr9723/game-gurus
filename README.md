## Application Description: 
Game Gurus is a video game forum that keeps users in the loop on all things video game related. The user logs into their personal account and is taken to the home page, which acts as a collection space where the most popular as well as newest games are displayed. There are also preview videos of gameplay from selected games that are popular. Every game in our database has its own gamepage which provides more information about the game such as, game description, key descriptors, top reviews, and even screenshots of active gameplay. 

Not seeing what you’re looking for? Users are able to use the search bar to browse their favorite games and are also able to post their personal ratings and reviews to respective gamepages. By posting a review and rating, the user adds the game to their personal dashboard where they can access all the games they have previously interacted with. A separate page labeled ‘archive’ hosts a larger volume of video games organized by genre where the user can explore games they might be interested in. By selecting a different ‘genre’ and/or ‘theme’ buttons, different video games will be displayed to the user based on their selections.
