Meeting Notes and Feedback

- Make sure to add register into the demo

- Simplify the slides in the powerpoint (talk more, have audience read less)

- Mention how you rated the different tools. How you used it, why you rated it the way you did.

- Macy: challenge - solution. If you had a problem, how did you overcome it? Don't explain too much, keep it short and sweet. 

- Rehearse a script, get everything streamlined. 

- Nikita liked how Max highlighted what you can access without being logged in.

- She liked what Jared went over as far as features specific to when you're logged in, etc.

- Tony: keep things simple, dont mention anything too technical. Save for Q&A.
