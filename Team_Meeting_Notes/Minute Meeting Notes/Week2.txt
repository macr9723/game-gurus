04/17/2023 TA Check-in

Nikita: So let me see your project board, is everyone finding the project board useful? You don't have to be scared if you are not finding it helpful
		then we want to know that as well so we can figure out a way to make it useful for everyone.

(Everyone likes project board)


Nikita: Lets do the Demo then.

Alakh: So I can walk us through the flow for now, and show how the API's are interacting with the pages, etc.
		Also, the game page is going to be for each game, individually. For example, if I click on SW: Eclipes it takes me to the game page,
		which will show reviews, scores, etc.
		For the game archive, which is going to be the library, we will also have a category/genre list, but that will be more of a front-end thing.		

Nikita: Everything looks good so far with the project, you have so much done already.
		Let's discuss flow, how this whole thing is going to flow. So the user is going to take a game which can be added to user's profile. 
		Not actually creating a game, but should be able to add to profile. You will definitely need a new table for that like a mapping table users-to-games.

Alakh: We have a table that will achieve this alr [sic].

Nikita: Also need profile page?

Alakh: Dashboard would fulfill this role.

Nikita: Okay, sounds like everything is well planned out. Does anyone have any concerns about the project moving forward?

Macy: Would you like to see the release notes?

Nikita: Yes, please.
		Okay, those look great. Thank you everyone.
